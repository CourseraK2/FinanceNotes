    Internal users are those individuals or groups who are within the organisation
    like owners, management, employees and trade unions.\n  + External users: External
    users are those individuals or groups who are outside the organisation like creditors,
    investors,\nbanks and other lending institutions, present and potential investors,
    Government, tax authorities, regulatory agencies and researchers.\n - __Branches
    of Accounting__ \n  + Financial A/Cing = recording of transaction\n  + Cost A/Cing
    = classification and calculation of different costs\n  + Management A/Cing = takes
    input frm (1) & (2) branches and helps managers in controlling, planning and decision
    making. \n+ Final Accounts => trading account, profit&loss account and balance
    sheet \\\\\n - __Need of final accounts__ => is to know\n  + gross profit/ loss
    and net profit/loss\n  + financial position (assets and liabilities)\n  + calculation
    of income tax & other taxes\n  + amount receivable&payable\n  + forecating of

    Expense => \\\\ \n\\\\\nExpense = cost for conducting main revenue-generating
    activity of a business (cost of making products) = cost of goods sold \\\\ \n\\\\\nCost
    = expense + other costs which are not directly related to the main revenue gemnerating
    activity of business.\\\\\n\\\\\nThus, EXPENSE (COGS) is the direct cost related
    to the production of goods sold by the business entity. This may include cost
    of RM + cost of direct labour + any depreciation amount of asset (for those assets
    directly requird for manufacturing that product).\n\\\\\n Eg:\n + if a furniture
    business has procured wood worth rs 500 out of which wood worth rs 400 is used
    to make the furniture then only rs 400 is expense while rs 100 is the asset because
    it could be used later to make furniture.\n + in a garment business, if i have
    purchased rs. 10,000 worth of 5 rolls of silk cloth (so per roll cost is rs. 2000)
    and only 4 rolls are used. also, the labour employed is rs. 3000 out of which
    direct labour employed is rs.500.  So rs. 8500 is expense (i.e used cloth and
    cost of direct labour) while the rest rs. 4500 (i.e  cost of 1 roll and cost of
    indirect labour ) is included in other costs.\\\\\n+ Revenue = total income before
    expenses. \\\\\nRevenue include\n + Operating Revenue (from main activity of business)\n
    + Interest income\n + Service Revenue\n + Fees Earned\n+ Transactions =  activities
    of a business involving transfer of money / goods / services between 2  persons
    / 2 accounts. \\\\\nTypes :\n + Cash = cash rcvd/paid immediately\n + Credit =
    rcpt of cash / payment in cash is delayed\n+ Proprietor = person/s owning a business\n+
    Capital = the amount of money invested in a business (increases with profit and
    decreases with loss). Its a liability (because business and businessman are separate
    entities and hence business owes this amount to its owner)\n\n\n\t\n\n====================\n\n===
